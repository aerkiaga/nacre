## TODO
* Accept a simpler call syntax.
  - Allow omitting any preceding type parameters.
  - Allow omitting non-type preceding parameters.
  - Allow dot syntax for "self" function call.
* Improve logical foundation.
  - Allow axiomatization of inductive principles.
  - Explore whether axiomatization of type-specific
    indefinite description is consistent and sufficient
    to prove the types' uniqueness.
  - Investigate what types should be given this
    axiomatization at minimum (e.g. equality).
* Check all TODOs in code.
